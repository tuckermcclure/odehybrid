The odehybrid library makes it easy to create simulations of dynamical systems with both continuous-time components (such as physical models) and multiple discrete-time components (such as digital controllers and signal processors). It's like MATLAB's built-in ode45 function, but extended for discrete-time systems, complex state organization, and logging.
